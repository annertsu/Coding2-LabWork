# Week 3 - Python Challenge

#### What did I do?

I completed the first 7 levels of the online Python Challenge using Jupyter Notebooks. I tried to avoid looking straight at the answer, but still had to get a lot of help from online resources. When I did look at the answers after many attempts at cracking the code, I made sure to understand each line before moving on.

#### What did I learn?

As mentioned above, I had to research online as I wasn't familiar with many of the modules and functions that were required in proceeding to the next level. But looking them up helped me tremendously to learn the absolute basics of Python. Also, I initially found it slightly difficult to switch to the Python syntax after learning Javascript and C++, but got used to it while using them through the Python challenge.

#### How should the code run?

All seven levels of the Python Challenge code is in the file titled ***Python Challenge.ipynb*** and seperated by comments/annotation. The answer for each level is also written as comments in bolded letters.
