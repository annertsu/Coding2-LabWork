# Week 4 - Python Webscraper

#### What did I do?

For this week's in-class activity, I extracted all the paragraph text from a page from one of my favorite typography design websites. I then used gensim to autosummarise the text into a short 100 word paragraph and also extracted reoccuring keywords on the page.

#### What did I learn?

The previous week's Python challenge gave me a basic understanding of importing modules, but I feel that this week gave me more of a contextual background of when it would be most useful to use various packages. More specifically through using BeautifulSoup and Gensim, I learned that it can give you a rather accurate summary and nudged me to experiment with auto-summarising academic papers. I also learned that using the help() and dir() functions are quite useful for debugging as well as for learning.

#### How should the code run?

The code is in the file titled ***Autosummarisation.ipynb***. The extracted paragraph text, summary and keywords are all labeled with bolded text.
