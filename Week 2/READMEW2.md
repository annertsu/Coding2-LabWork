# Week 2 - First OF Project

#### What did I do?

For the second week's lab, I used the Javascript code from the interactive circle script introduced during the 2D graphics unit as the basis for my first Open Framework exercise. I have included a short screen recording (titled JStoOF.mov) of the c++ code running. 

#### What did I learn?

Through this exercise, I feel that I was able to get a general understanding of setting up and using Open Frameworks for creative visual outputs, as well as the basics of coding in c++. It initially took me a bit of time to grasp which piece of code goes into which file as I swapped between the .hpp file and the two .cpp file. I also realised that the structure of the Javascript and C++ code are similar, however I did have to look up the C++ equivalent of the Javascript method and attribute names.
